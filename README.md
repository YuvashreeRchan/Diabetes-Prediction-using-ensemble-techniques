# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ensemble-techniques

The main aim of this study is to improve the accuracy of diabetes mellitus prediction by utilizing 
various machine learning techniques, including ensemble methods such as Stacking, Hard Voting, 
and Soft Voting, with base classifiers like AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, 
Gradient Boost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Extra Trees, and Cat Boost. For this 
experimentation, we will be using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which gathers details on 
patients with and without diabetes, to construct and evaluate each model before selecting the 
optimal ensemble model to address this issue. The best performing model was the ensemble model 
using soft voting. However, the model had a high bias and low variance, which was addressed by 
calibration. The final model achieved an accuracy of 93.75%, precision of 95.24%, recall of 
86.96%, and an F1 score of 90.91%. This study highlights the potential of machine learning 
techniques for predicting diabetes and the importance of calibration to improve model 
performance.
